  <h1>about me:</h1>
</p>

<p align="center">
  hi, I'm Gabriel
</p>

<p align="center">
  and I am a security researcher currently working on an open source intelligence gathering framework called <strong>seekfind</strong>
</p>

<hr>

<p align="center">
  <h2>the project objectives:</h2>
</p>

<p align="center">
  ► seekfind is built with open source intelligence principles, but its full capabilities are reserved for serious use.<br>
  ► a private, closed-source version will be licensed to security firms, intelligence agencies, and governmental bodies.<br>
  ► the open-source limited of it will be available right here on this repo and you can use it as well.<br>
  ► no flashy GUI—just a clean, practical interface designed for real work, not aesthetics.<br>
  ► function comes first. this isn't retro software; it's purpose-built for the present.
